YouTube Title Optimization Website
Tools Used
Material UI
React.js
Project Overview:
We are developing a frontend-only website that compares the efficiency of two data structures: a Trie and a HashMap. Our goal is to visualize and analyze their performance in searching YouTube video titles.

Key Features
Comparison of Data Structures: We implement both a Trie and a HashMap to compare their search performance.
Real-Time Animation: When a user searches for a YouTube video title, the website will animate the search process for better visualization.
Title Optimization for YouTubers: We analyze YouTube video titles based on metrics like comments, views, and likes to help content creators optimize their titles for better engagement.
Data Source:
The dataset used for this project was sourced via YouTube's video ID dataset from 2019 (newest) and YouTube's API for finding the video title, comments, views, and likes.
