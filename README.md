YouTube Title Analyzer Website
Tools Used
Material UI
React.js
Framer Motion
Project Overview:
We are developing a frontend-only website that compares the efficiency of two data structures: a Trie and a HashMap. Our goal is to visualize and analyze their performance in searching YouTube video titles.

Key Features
Comparison of Data Structures: We implement both a Trie and a HashMap to compare their search performance.
Real-Time Animation: When a user searches for a YouTube video title, the website will animate the search process for better visualization.
Title Optimization for YouTubers: We analyze YouTube video titles based on metrics like comments, views, and likes to help content creators optimize their titles for better engagement.
Data Source:
We used over 100,000 random videos from YouTube's API and found the video title, comments, views, and likes for each video.



Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
